Escape the labirynth type of game. But well... you're able to push walls to you advantage so that's not that hard. Just to make it  a little bit harder (and to have a study about finding paths algorythm) some hungry trolls are roaming arround.

- Game works in tkinter environment
- trolls can find you fairly easy
- after winning/losing player recives messages on the screen
- possibility to restart
